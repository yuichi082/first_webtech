The island is the best jump-off point to Pamilacan Island where you will enjoy the sight of frolicking dolphins and for whale watching; also to Balicasag Island for other world-famous diving sites; and to mainland Bohol for the Chocolate Hills, the tarsier, Prony the python, the countless falls, springs, and caves.</p>

Many foreigners chose to stay in the island and married local maidens. They put up their residences by the beach. But in due time, their properties were developed into resorts to accommodate the steady trickle of friends and acquaintances who come for a visit.

<h4>Panglao Island Philippines History</h4>
<br>
<p>Panglao was known to the traders from China and other Asian countries; even way back before the Spaniards set foot on its shores. Archaeological sites have yielded Tang, Sung and Ming dynasty porcelain and trade ware. Some years before the arrival of conquistador Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, there was a strong kingdom in an area in Bohol. The inhabitants were excellent oarsmen, fishermen and traders. According Loarca, the town had been plundered by men from Malucco, and most of its inhabitants fled to various places. Some settled in Panay, many others in Dapitan, in Northern Mindanao.</p>
<br>
<p>By all indications, the Dapitan Kingdom was well located in the strait formed by the island of Bohol and that of Panglao. At the time of Combes, many brazas in the sea stood certain columns of upright wood, as honorable witnesses of the location so gloriously occupied by this nation. The Dapitanons inhabited both shores and the entire island of Panglao, exercising dominion in Bohol: from the shore of the strait to the coast of Baclayon. They had trade and diplomatic relations with the Ternatans, who eventually came and raided them because they had cut off the noses and ears of the envoy from Ternate and many men in his entourage for having made advances to the royal concubine.</p>

<p>To accomplish his revenge and conquer the Dapitan Kingdom, the Ternatan King employed a dark and infamous device. He sent his joangas in, one by one, on the pretext of trading. The Dapitanons, seeing the innocence of their enterprise, dropped their guard. When their fleet had been brought together, the Ternatans attacked with muskets and arquebuses furnished to them by the Portuguese.

Prince Dailisan was killed and his brother. Prince Pagbuaya was left the reigning prince. The entire Dapitan nation decided to disperse, with the majority settling in Mindanao.

When the Spaniards came, they still noticed the remnants of the old Kingdom which could become a bulwark of a flourishing civilization or perhaps a citadel of native genius counterpart to that of several European mercantile capitals.

It is recorded in the history of the island that the Spaniards came to Panglao in search of fresh water in the year 1803. The Spaniards showed signs of friendship so they were welcomed by the natives. Few natives making their fishing device called "panggaw" were at the shore. A Spaniard pointing down asked what the name of the place was. The natives, who believed that the visitor was asking what they were making, answered "Panggaw." Thru the years, the name evolved from “panggaw” to Panglaw and finally to Panglao.

<h4>Panglao Island Philippines Location</h4>
<br>
<p>Panglao Island is estimated to be only 20 kilometers away from Tagbilaran City and highly accessible. It takes only 20 minutes to reach it and a few minutes more to reach the beaches of your choice. Located off the southwestern tip of Bohol and east of Cebu in the Central Visayas, the island is divided into two municipalities: Dauis in the northeast and Panglao in the southwest. It is part of the Bohol province and is connected to the Bohol mainland by two bridges.</p>
<br>
<p>Its terrain ranges from plain, hilly to mountainous. Highly made up of Maribojoc limestone which is the youngest of the limestone units found in the western area of Bohol, this coralline limestone type is soluble and causes formation of caves and sinkholes.
The island has no river or lakes yet the inhabitants have, as its water source, the freshwater spring inside the Hinagdanan Cave and also the “miraculous” spring found inside the church at Dauis.
